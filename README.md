## SwiftRandom

The SwiftRandom package generates various types of random numbers using the Mersenne Twister algorithm
or the Permuted Congruential Generator algorithm.

It generates the following:

* Random floating point values in a specified open or closed range
* Random integers in a specified open or closed range
* Random unsigned integers in a specified open or closed range
* Random bits
* A uniform distribution in a specified open or closed range
* A normal distribution with specified mean and deviation
* An exponential distribution with specified mean

SwiftRandom is not suitable for cryptographic applications.

SwiftRandom requires Swift 5.0. It also requires that the `Int` and `UInt` types be 64 bit types.

Its documentation is build with the DocC plugin and published on GitHub Pages at this location:

The documentation is also available in the *SwiftRandom.doccarchive* file.
